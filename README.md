### Problem Statement:-

A company with multiple branches across India provides computer hardware and peripherals to its clients.
However, the sales director is facing challenges in understanding the company’s current issues and performance,
as sales have been falling short of expectations. When seeking updates from regional managers, 
the director often receives overly optimistic reports and a flood of Excel files, 
which only adds to the frustration. 
This is understandable, as it's difficult to interpret numbers solely from Excel spreadsheets.

### Solution:-

As a data analyst, I propose a solution to address the sales director’s challenges at the company:
implementing PowerBI dashboards for data visualization and analysis. These dashboards can consolidate data
from various sources, including the company’s sales figures, market trends, and regional manager reports.
With these tools, the sales director can easily view the current business status, identify problem areas, 
and make informed, data-driven decisions.

By providing a clear, visual representation of the data, the sales director can move away from relying on 
Excel files and overly optimistic reports from regional managers, reducing misunderstandings and frustration.

### Tools used: MySQL, Microsoft Power BI, Power Query Editor, DAX
