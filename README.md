### Problem Statement:-

A hardware company with multiple branches across India is struggling with declining sales. The sales director receives overly optimistic reports and numerous Excel files from regional managers, making it difficult to understand the company's issues and performance.
### Solution:-

Implementing PowerBI dashboards for data visualization and analysis. These dashboards will consolidate data from sales figures, market trends, and regional manager reports, allowing the sales director to easily view the business status, identify issues, and make informed decisions.

With clear visual representations of data, the sales director can move away from Excel files and overly optimistic reports, reducing misunderstandings and frustration.

### Data:-
I have been provided with the SQL dataset which contains Sales customers,Sales date,Sales transactions,Sales Markets,Sales Products from CodeBasics.
